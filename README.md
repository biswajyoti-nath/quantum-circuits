# My Quantum Circuit Experiments with Qiskit ⚛

This repository marks the beginning of my journey into *quantum computing* using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/).

## 🚀 Current Progress
Right now, this repository contains my very first *“Hello World”* quantum circuit, which I built to get hands-on with Qiskit.

## 📂 What's Inside
- hello_world_quantum_circuit.ipynb — My first working quantum circuit using Qiskit.

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists
Although this project started with a simple “Hello World” circuit, I plan to expand it gradually by:
- Exploring basic quantum gates and algorithms.
- Simulating entanglement and quantum randomness.
- Eventually building more complex quantum programs and research projects.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Qiskit (Python)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 💡 Future Plans
This repo will grow over time as I learn more about quantum computing and apply it to real-world problems.

Small beginnings. Big ambitions.
